## Branch Protection Rules Screenshot Description

The screenshots provided demonstrate the branch protection rules applied to the `main` branch. These rules enforce:

- **Pull request reviews**: At least one approval is required before any changes can be merged, ensuring peer review and accountability.
- **Blocking force pushes**: Prevents destructive changes to branch history, protecting the integrity of the codebase.
- **Restricted direct pushes**: All contributions must go through pull requests, aligning with CI/CD best practices.

These rules are essential for maintaining a secure and stable development
