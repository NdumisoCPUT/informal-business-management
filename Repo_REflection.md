One of the biggest lessons I learned during the peer review phase wasn’t about complex code or CI configurations — it was about something as simple as linking files. I had spent weeks building out markdown documentation, following all the assignment requirements, and committing everything to the repository. But when peers began reviewing the project, I got feedback that stopped me in my tracks: many of the key files were there, but nobody could find them.

The issue wasn’t that the markdown files were missing — they were all present in the repository. The problem was that I hadn’t linked them anywhere in the README.md, which meant reviewers had to dig through the file list to find important documents like Contribution.md, IMPROVEMENT_REFLECTION.md, Board.md, and Swagger UI.md. What I had completely underestimated was how much that disrupted the flow of understanding the project.

This feedback made me realize that when working on collaborative or open-source projects, visibility and accessibility matter just as much as content. It’s not enough to have the files — they have to be clearly presented. In response, I revised the “System Documentation” section in the README.md and added every missing link. I didn’t just dump them into a list — I grouped them logically and used meaningful link text to make navigation easier for reviewers and future contributors.

What surprised me was how much of a difference that small change made. Once the files were linked and the README.md became a true hub for the project, the whole repo felt cleaner, more understandable, and more professional. Contributors didn’t need to guess where things were or scroll endlessly — everything was one click away.

Beyond that, the experience taught me to slow down and double-check things that are easy to overlook. I had assumed the presence of the files was enough. I was focused on writing clean code and passing CI checks, but missed the fact that clarity and structure are part of code quality too — especially when the audience includes peers, supervisors, or potential contributors.

Another insight from this feedback was the role of the README.md. Originally, I treated it like a place to put setup instructions and a one-line description. But now I understand it needs to function like a homepage. It should guide the reader through the entire repo, including technical documentation, test results, diagrams, workflows, and policies. That shift in mindset helped me reorganize the file into a much more useful resource.

Finally, the process reinforced the importance of feedback itself. I wouldn’t have caught the unlinked files without someone else pointing it out. And once they did, it gave me the chance to fix it before final submission — not just for marks, but for the actual usability of the project.
