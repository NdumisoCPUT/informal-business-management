Improving this repository based on peer feedback was an eye-opening process that highlighted how small changes can significantly enhance collaboration, clarity, and maintainability. One of the most consistent suggestions from peers was to make the structure of the repository clearer and ensure all documentation was traceable from one central point. To respond to this, I made sure the README.md not only introduced the project but also linked out to all other .md files, such as the system documentation, diagrams, test results, and protection rules.

Additionally, peers noted that while CI/CD was present, it wasn't obvious how it functioned or what triggered artifact generation. I addressed this by updating the .github/workflows/ci.yml file to include not only testing on every push and PR, but also an artifact build job triggered only when changes were merged into the main branch. I documented this logic and included screenshots like release-artifact-screenshot.md to illustrate the outcome. This added transparency to how deployment was automated and improved reviewer confidence in the workflow.

The challenge of onboarding contributors was another important lesson. I had assumed that the project’s structure was self-explanatory, but feedback revealed confusion about how to run the system and especially how to run tests. To fix this, I created a proper requirements.txt file and setup.py for easy setup and packaging. I also added explicit instructions in the README.md on setting up the virtual environment, installing dependencies, and running pytest or unittest. This lowered the barrier to entry for new collaborators.

Another major lesson was the value of CI-based gatekeeping. At the start, contributors could merge PRs without checks, leading to broken builds. I implemented status checks that require tests to pass before merging. This was later captured in the screenshot pr-blocked-tests.md, showing a PR blocked due to test failures. This mechanism significantly improved code quality and accountability.

Lastly, this project taught me about the nuances of open-source collaboration. Communication became central — from clear commit messages and pull request descriptions to consistent naming across branches (e.g., ndumiso-cput-fix-domain-tests). I learned that asynchronous collaboration thrives on clarity. Creating markdown files for every significant milestone — from Board.md to Reflection.md — made it easier for others to understand the project’s direction without needing real-time communication.

In conclusion, this experience has sharpened my ability to lead and maintain a collaborative software project. By applying feedback, documenting clearly, and enforcing code quality through CI/CD, I’ve laid the foundation for sustainable contributions from both myself and others. I now appreciate that clean code alone isn't enough — clean workflows, documentation, and collaboration are just as important.
