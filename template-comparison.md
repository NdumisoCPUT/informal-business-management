# Justification
For the SME Digitalization Project, the Automated Kanban template was selected as the most suitable option. This choice was based on three main factors: workflow clarity, built-in automation, and Agile compatibility.

Firstly, its columns — Triage, Backlog, In Progress, Done — reflect a natural development process. This structure makes it easy to follow work items as they move from planning to completion, which is ideal for features like user login, inventory management, and payment processing.

Secondly, its automation features reduce manual updates by automatically moving issues based on their status and closing completed ones. This keeps the board up to date and reduces human error, which is especially helpful for smaller teams with limited project management capacity.

Finally, this template supports an Agile way of working without overcomplicating the process. Compared to the Team Planning template, which is better suited for larger teams running formal sprints, the Automated Kanban provides flexibility for iterative development. It also avoids the overhead of templates like Bug Triage, which are more appropriate for maintenance tasks.

In summary, Automated Kanban strikes the best balance for this project: simple yet effective workflows, useful automation, and strong Agile alignment — all of which support the goal of delivering working software quickly and consistently.
