| Template Name      | Columns/Workflow                           | Automation Features                              | Agile Suitability                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basic Kanban**   | To Do, In Progress, Done                    | None                                             | Simple and clear, but lacks automation; okay for very small teams           |
| **Automated Kanban**| Triage, Backlog, In Progress, Done         | Auto-move issues based on status updates         | Very Agile-friendly, great for continuous workflows and quicker updates     |
| **Team Planning**  | Icebox, Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, Done | Iteration planning, auto-move, team assignment  | Best suited for structured Agile teams using sprints and regular planning   |

## Justification

For this SME Digitalization system, **Automated Kanban** is the best fit. It offers built-in automation to move issues based on status, making it easier to manage tasks like user login, inventory, and payments. Since the project is focused on Agile delivery and possibly a small team size, this template gives both flexibility and support for iterative delivery without overcomplicating things.
