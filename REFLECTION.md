# Reflection: Challenges in Translating Requirements to Use Cases and Tests
During this project, one of the biggest challenges I faced was turning written requirements into clear user stories, use cases, and test plans. At first, I thought it would be simple because I understood what the system was supposed to do. But when I started writing detailed user stories and creating the use case diagram, I realized it was harder than I expected.

I struggled to break down high-level ideas into smaller actions. For example, “track inventory” sounds clear, but when I had to define exactly what actions the user can take and what the system must do, I found it hard to stay detailed and realistic. It took a lot of back-and-forth, especially when writing the acceptance criteria and listing dependencies for each story. This step was important because everything else depended on how well I wrote the user stories.

Estimating effort was also difficult. I had to give numbers between 1 and 5 to show how much work each user story would take. Without a team to ask, I had to guess based on what I know. I had to think about how long it would take to set up Firebase login, or how many steps were needed to process a payment. Sometimes I gave a higher number just to be safe. I realized that estimating takes practice and experience.

Prioritizing stories using the MoSCoW method helped me think about what was important. Marking something as a “Must-have” meant it was needed for the core of the app to work. This helped when selecting stories for the sprint backlog. Still, it was hard to decide between “Should-have” and “Could-have” without talking to real users or stakeholders.

Another challenge was using GitHub Projects for Agile planning. I had to create issues, assign labels, and move tasks through columns like “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Done.” Learning how to add sub-issues and link tasks correctly took time. Some of my issues ended up in the “No Status” column because I forgot to update them properly.

I also created a use case diagram in draw.io, and converting it to Mermaid.js code was tricky because Mermaid doesn't fully support UML diagrams. I had to simplify things to make it work. This showed me how different tools have limits.

Even though I’m the only stakeholder right now, I had to imagine what a business owner, customer, and admin would want from the system. I used those roles in my use case diagram and user stories. It was hard to represent their needs without real interviews, but it helped to think through each feature from their point of view.

In the end, I learned that translating requirements into a working Agile plan takes time, clear thinking, and attention to detail. It also takes patience because mistakes happen, and I had to fix many things along the way. This reflection helped me see how much thought goes into early planning stages of software development.
