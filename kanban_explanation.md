# Kanban Board Explanation
## What is a Kanban Board?
A Kanban board is a simple visual tool that helps manage tasks by showing what needs to be done, what’s being worked on, and what’s already completed. It uses columns to represent the different stages a task goes through. This makes it easy for anyone in the team to quickly see where things stand.

## How My Board Works
### Visualizes Workflow
My board is divided into columns like:

Backlog (tasks we haven’t started yet),

Ready (tasks ready to start),

In Progress (tasks currently being worked on),

In Review (tasks waiting for feedback),

Testing, Blocked, and Done.

This setup shows the full journey of a task from start to finish and helps the team stay organized.

## Limits Work-In-Progress (WIP)
To avoid overload, I don’t allow more than three active tasks per column like “In Progress.” This keeps the team focused, reduces multitasking, and helps us finish work before taking on new items.

## Supports Agile Principles
The board supports Agile because:

It allows us to deliver small chunks of work often.

It’s easy to adjust tasks or priorities based on feedback.

It shows who is doing what, with tasks assigned to team members and tagged using labels like inventory, authentication, and notifications
